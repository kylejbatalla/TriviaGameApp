# Trivia Game App, Built With Android Studio
This project serves as my first android studio app. The app is a gereral trivia game app with a series of 3 difficulties. There are a total of 90 questions and 360 different answer choices. The user has the options to choose difficulty, play again, view results, and exit the app. This project was constructed mainly using object oriented programming with setters and getters, and data strucutres such as array lists and hash sets.
